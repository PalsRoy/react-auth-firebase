This project is a simple project React Firebase chat app.

FIREBASE is a BAAS (backend as a service) that provides many useful tools for mobile and web development. In its offer, we can find Hosting (even for node apps), real-time database (what we are interested in), and authentication using E-mail, Facebook or Google.
